		Scraping another web page
		GStringExpressions without { and }
		Exceptionhandler in the dispatcher, see appstart
		params through args is a risk
		Extract gosh framework into seperate project
		New markup:
			<% ... %{ ... }%>
			<% ... %{ ... }% ... %>
			<%// ...
		<%-- comment should also use the complete line algorithm
		Removal of excess whitespace from the template, needs compile time script execution <%% removeExcessWhitespace = true %%>
		Apply the improvements from GroovyPageCompiler to QueryCompiler
		Precompile queries
		Use one GroovyClassLoader
		Using ghtml files for tags
		Compression?
		Merge groovypagemanager and querymanager. Merge groovypagecompiler and querycompiler.
SPECIAL	Compile time execution <%% flkjflkj %%>
			-> multiple pages from one template
			-> pre generate html
				-> further centralization 
		Need default page
		Test mocking with groovy in GoSH
		binding of errors to fields?
		errorcode translation
		resourcebundles
		Should the template be able to add things to the RequestContext?
		Should args attributes also be made available directly, as long as no conflict with existing attributes.
		Should templates also work without the call to fragment()? (body only)
		Automatic log field
		stacktrace on screen does not work correctly if response is already committed.

DONE	Rename .gsp to .ghtml
DONE	gsp Resources via Spring?
DONE	not given an argument to the query results in propertynotfound
DONE	Don't read controllers and services from the classloader during development
DONE	Bind to an array of ints? Configure params to return arrays of ints or whatever.
DONE	How to add custom function libraries to gosh pages and controller actions
DONE	Param type should be added not set
DONE	OverridingMap for the args
DONE	newsyear
DONE	Args should fallback to params?, make a map out of the params
DONE	Linenumbers in ghtml and gsql
DONE	include action without the need to specify the controller
DONE	Groovy does not add linenumbers to class files?
DONE	Rename .sql to .gsql
DONE	Implement RequestContext and RequestParamsWrapper in java 
DONE	XML controllers should not have a default 'index' action
DONE	Possibility to easier get to the MarkupBuilder
DONE	Build for production (without the spring groovy integration)
DONE	Login actions should always redirect, also if there is an error. We want to prevent the POST to appear in the browser history.
DONE	Need to do something with the page packages
DONE	Move pages from WEB-INF to classes
DONE	Remove Script superclass from the gsql
DONE	Don't escape \ in ${} expressions, maybe done
DONE	Autoencode only for specific mimetypes.
DONE	PageManagers: split reloading into precompiled and reloading.
DONE	Include from other sources, like a normal include
DONE	Appserver Include/forward (like servlets, jsps)
DONE	Possibility to have gxml and ghtml and gcsv etc within one DispatcherServlet
DONE	Page and query precompile

Groovy exceptionhandling problems:
	1. Calling getProperty() from java gives MissingPropertyExceptionNoStack
