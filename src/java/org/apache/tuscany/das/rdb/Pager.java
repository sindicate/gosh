/**
 * An iterator-like interface to conveniently move through chunks of data. The 
 * idea is that a Pager works with a read Command. The read command
 * returns a large amount of data and the client wants to work with chunks 
 * of it at a time. So the Pager is created on the command and each call to
 * next returns the next chunk of data. This is done completely disconnected. 
 * No cursor is maintained between calls to #next.
 * 
 * TODO - This is very preliminary. We need to look at this interface 
 * in the context of disonnected scenarios such as a web app. The Pager instance
 * will probably be saved in session so it must be very light and cannot 
 * reference a connection. Also, we probably need to define a factory or add a
 * method to set page size.
